            Iâ€™m a <strong>passionate AI & Machine Learning Engineer</strong> who thrives on transforming complex challenges into elegant, AI-driven solutions. 
            With an <strong>MSc in Artificial Intelligence</strong> from Queen Mary University of London (Russell Group) and a <strong>B.Tech in Computer Science</strong>, my journey has been fueled by an 
            <em>insatiable curiosity</em>, evolving from a code enthusiast into a tech innovator.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Over the years, Iâ€™ve engineered cutting-edge AI solutions that push boundaries:</strong></p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 20px;">
            <li><strong>Fraud detection systems</strong> for blockchain gaming, enhancing security and user experience.</li>
            <li><strong>Sophisticated RAG chatbots</strong> designed for high-speed, high-accuracy query handling.</li>
            <li><strong>Predictive healthcare models</strong>, improving patient outcomes through intelligent forecasting.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            My toolbox is brimming with the latest technologies in <strong>Generative AI, Reinforcement Learning, NLP, and Computer Vision</strong>. 
            I leverage frameworks like <strong>TensorFlow</strong> and <strong>PyTorch</strong>, along with cloud platforms such as <strong>Azure, Docker, and Kubernetes</strong>, 
            to build scalable, high-impact AI solutions.

        <p>I donâ€™t just build AI, I engineer intelligence that scales. Whether it's designing <strong>LLM architectures</strong>, optimizing <strong>ML pipelines</strong>, or deploying models seamlessly in production, my work is driven by <strong>precision, performance, and real-world impact</strong>.</p>
        <p>When Iâ€™m not training models, youâ€™ll likely find me <em>optimizing my caffeine intake</em> or pondering whether AI will ever grasp sarcasm as well as I do.</p>
